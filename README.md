# Flights-Data-Exploration
# ✈️ U.S. Flight Data Analysis with Python

A personal project exploring real-world U.S. flight data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
The goal: transform messy, raw data into meaningful insights and clear visualizations.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

🔍 **Data Cleaning**  
• Handled missing values  
• Standardized formats and column names  
• Prepared data for analysis with Pandas

📊 **Data Exploration & Visualization**  
• Analyzed flight delays by airline  
• Identified peak travel months  
• Explored flight volume trends over the year  
• Visualized findings using Matplotlib

🧠 **Skills Practiced**  
• Data wrangling with Pandas  
• Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
• Data visualization fundamentals  
• Asking the right questions from the data
